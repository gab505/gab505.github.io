After finishing taking AP Computer Science the following year, I also learned other language other than java from the other programmer outside school. Such programming skills enabled me to explore many things that I did not know about computer before and also to create this website as well. I also managed to license a usuable application as well.</p></div></section><section class="menuSection religion"><div class="barImg top"><img src="https://gab505.github.io/pictures/church/AKUX9aFam4nUWzxIZQTwuqBDbE8HJ0owyrobH5NGWlwJ9pa4Gkm9lNB8_5fljoJXHsRKBIt-gUEZ8A6uAlOp_PdjWDQkQ6-1NGx8tvMY3X9jNE4Tl9FkO7ckdR_J-oNfeA--.jpeg"/></div><div class="text"><h1>Religious Affiliation</h1><p>Catholic background is one of the major aspects when describing myself.

I've been to Western European countries such as Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, France, Germany, Austria and Germany, Vietnam, Philippines, Guatemala and Dominican Republic.</p><p>Each trip was a valuable experience to learn different and unfamiliar culture outside my daily boundary. This is why I look forward to studying outside the States even I go to college.</p></div></section><section class="menuSection teaching"><div class="barImg bottom"><img src="https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LflS4MogHzjyXvB6ykWUaQ/348s.jpg"/></div><div class="text"><h1>Teaching</h1><p>This is my fourth year of teaching elementary students how to speak and write in Korean at Our Lady of Peace(Catholic Church I go to). First two years, I worked as a Teaching Assistant to help teachers prepare for their classes, and after that I had my own class to teach.</p><p>Teaching kids who often becomes disrupt and disinterested is challenging, but it is still one of the most valuable experiences in my life that taught me patience and empathy to get along with people who are quite different from me.</p></div></section><section class="menuSection volunteer"><div class="barImg left"><img src="https://gab505.github.io/pictures/guatemala/1467002587614.jpg"/></div><div class="text"><h1>Volunteer Work</h1><p>During three summer vacations during Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior year, I went to Guatemala twice and Dominican Republic once as a volunteering trip. Because I felt like I'm still in my comfort zone whenever I volunteered within the States, I wanted to experience volunteering in a true sense at places that are new and unfamiliar to me.</p></div></section><section class="menuSection soccer"><div class="barImg top"><img src="https://gab505.github.io/pictures/soccer/IMG_2676.JPG"/></div><div class="text"><h1>Soccer</h1><p>I am also one of huge sports fan.

During free time, I like to go to a park near my house and play soccer with people whom I don't even know.</p><p>I played soccer at school for two years, and will definitely play soccer at college, too.</p><br/><br/></div></section><Section class="menuSection kendo"><div class="barImg top"><img src="https://gab505.github.io/pictures/kendo/20160227_202851.jpg"/></div><div class="text"><h1>Kendo</h1><p>I've been a Kendo Practitioner since 8th grade. For me and other Kendo practitioners, Kendo is not merely a sport, but also a challenging, inspiring training that influences our personality and ability to concentrate to the every moment of our lives.</p><p>During the five valuable years of playing Kendo, I promoted 5 times total and earned '1st Dan'. I also participated in various competitions held by different Kendo Federations and enjoyed the opportunity of competing with people who are better Kendo Practitioners than I am and learn my strength and weakness.</p></div></Section><section class="bottom"><h1>Portfolio</h1><div class="hr"></div><p>This is DG's portfolio</p><p>gab505.github.io</p></section></body></html>
